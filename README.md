# Deep Learning Foundations Nanodegree 
## Neural Networks
### Project: My First Neural Network
## Overview

In this project, I got to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset! By building a neural network from the ground up, I have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation,  and other concepts that are important to know before mastering higher level toolssuch as Tensorflow. I also got to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

## Getting Started

### Environment

1. Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the Anaconda lesson.
2. Create a new conda environment:
```sh
    conda create --name dlnd python=3
```
3. Enter your new environment:
    1. Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd
    2. Windows: >> activate dlnd
4. Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:
```sh
    conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook
```
5. Run the following to open up the notebook server:
```sh
    jupyter notebook
```
6. In your browser, open Your_first_neural_network.ipynb
7. Follow the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project.
8. Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook before you submit the project!
